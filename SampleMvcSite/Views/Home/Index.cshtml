@*Usually the Index view is the first page of the website, however
    I prefer to just redirect to a home page. If you want the homepage to
    have a URL of www.websitename.com/ and not www.websitename.com/home/
    then we should use the Index view as the home page.It's all personal
    preference as far as I can tell, and we can discuss how we'd like to
    handle the Index view.*@
